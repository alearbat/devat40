            <h2>Starting a new life</h2>
            <h5>2019-04-01</h5>
            <p>You’re 40. Maybe things didn’t go as you thought in your professional life… or maybe they did, but you think you need a change. You know becoming a developer has a lot of benefits, but you also have some fears: is it possible to change my career being 40 years old? Is it too difficult to learn coding? Will I be able to find a new job as a Junior-Dev? Where do I must start? Which is the best way to study?... and the list continues…</p>
            <p>I believe you must follow your instinct and your passions! Enjoy to learn, plan a path, stay focused and you’ll achieve whatever you want.</p>
            <p>In this blog you will find a lot of information, advice, stories and links that will help you to reach your goal. <span>Go for it!</span></p>
